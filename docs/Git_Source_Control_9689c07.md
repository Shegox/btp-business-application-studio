# Git Source Control

SAP Business Application Studio enables you to connect and interact with the Git source control system, letting you connect and interact with remote Git repositories.

**Prerequisite**

-   Before you can work with the Git view, your administrator must establish a connection to your corporate Git system. See [Connect to Your Git Source Control System](Connect_to_Your_Git_Source_Control_System_e7a42bc.md).

-   Ask your administrator which is the recommended authentication method for your company. See [Connect to Your Git Source Control System](Connect_to_Your_Git_Source_Control_System_e7a42bc.md).


You can perform all your Git tasks using the terminal, but SAP Business Application Studio allows you to use the Git view if you prefer.

## Workflow

Using Git is easy. The basic workflow is as follows:

1.  **Clone:** Clone a repository from a remote Git source control system. All the information about the repository is copied, and a local master branch is created and is visible in your workspace. If the remote repository has several branches, you can create additional local branches based on those remote branches.

2.  **Develop:** Once you have the code, you can develop â€“ add files, delete files, modify files. Your changes are visible in the status table of the *Git* pane. When you are ready, you can stage your changes and commit them.

3.  **Fetch and Merge/Rebase:** \(Optional\) Before sending back your changes to the remote repository, you can fetch all the changes made by others. Then you can merge or rebase the changes into your changes to make sure there are no conflicts. If there are conflicts, you can adjust your code.

4.  **Push:** Add your changes to the remote repository.
