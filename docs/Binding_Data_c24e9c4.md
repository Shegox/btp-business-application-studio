# Binding Data

In the layout editor, you can bind properties of controls or control aggregations to an artifact in the OData service.



## Prerequisites

You have defined a data set for the view that you are working on, by doing one of the following:

-   If you are opening a view that has no data set defined for it, the *Data Binding* dialog box opens, where you can define a data set.

-   Select the view, and define the data set from the dropdown list.


> ### Caution:  
> If you change the data set that is defined for the current view, the existing data bindings might become invalid.



## Overview

The following types of bindings are possible:

-   Properties of controls

-   Aggregations of controls


> ### Note:  
> To bind properties of models that are not OData models, you must work from the source code files and not from the layout editor. Alternatively, if you do not want to work with the source files in the XML editor, you can enter free text for properties in the *Properties* pane.

> ### Note:  
> If your application does not consume an OData service, you can add the *OData Service* component to it.
