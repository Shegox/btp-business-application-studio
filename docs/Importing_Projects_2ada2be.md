# Importing Projects

Import projects from your local file system to SAP Business Application Studio.

If you have an SAP Web IDE project or a project you worked on in another IDE, you can save it as a ZIP or a TAR file and import it to SAP Business Application Studio.

1.  From the Welcome page, click *Import*, or select *Import Project* from the command palette.
2.  Select the desired ZIP or TAR file.
3.  Click *Open*.

The project is added to your dev space in a new workspace or as part or a multi-root workspace depending on the Workspace preferences that you defined.
