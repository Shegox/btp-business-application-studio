# Explore and Install VS Code Extensions

You can install VS Code extensions from the *Open VSX Registry* to get additional tools to support the development activities in your dev space.

> ### Note:  
> SAP provides you with a mechanism to access third-party sites to view and download open-source, 3rd party, or its own tools, libraries, or software components \(“Extensions”\) to dev spaces in SAP Business Application Studio. Using this mechanism, you can view and install VS Code Extensions from the VSX Open Registry at your own risk.
> 
> SAP does not certify or endorse any of the third-party sites or Extensions, and they are not part of SAP Business Application Studio.
> 
> You must ensure that you have and maintain all the necessary rights to use these Extensions.
> 
> You are responsible for all aspects of the Extensions, including maintenance, management, security, and support. SAP Business Application Studio does not support the auto-update feature for these extensions.
> 
> You will assume all responsibility for any negative effects caused by or relating to the Extensions.
> 
> SAP may elect, in its sole discretion, to disable any dev space that includes Extensions that cause system malfunction or that SAP reasonably believes may cause harm to SAP systems.
