# Template Wizard

SAP Business Application Studio allows you to use any type of Yeoman generator including project and module generators.

> ### Note:  
> When you create a project using a template, you become the code owner and as such, you are responsible for any updates or fixes that must be performed for it. We recommend you follow the industry best practice of using automated vulnerability scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to avoid supply chain and other cyber-attacks.

1.  Enter ***Open Template Wizard*** in the command palette.

    The Template wizard opens showing all the Yeoman generators that are installed in your machine.

2.  Follow the wizard steps and provide the required information. You can move between steps using the *Previous* and *Next* buttons or clicking the steps from the wizard tree.

    The wizard displays error notifications on the field level as well as on the step level.

3.  If you already have an open workspace, at the conclusion of the wizard, choose if you want to open the artifact in a new workspace or add it to the existing one, thus moving to multi-root mode.

If you do not find a wizard that suits your development needs, you can search for more wizards using the ***Explore and Install Generators***.
