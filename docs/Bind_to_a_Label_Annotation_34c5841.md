2.  In the *Properties* pane to the right of the canvas, do one of the following:

    -   To the right of the property to which you want to bind data, click the *Binding* ![](images/data_binding_button_852457c.jpg) button, and then in the dialog box that appears:
        1.  From the drop down list, select *Labels*, double-click one or more annotation that you want to add to the expression.

            The annotations are automatically concatenated to the string in the *Expression* box.

        2.  Click *OK* or first manually edit the expression string and then click *OK*.
