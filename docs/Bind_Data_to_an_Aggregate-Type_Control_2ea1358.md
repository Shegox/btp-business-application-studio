## Prerequisites

-   You have defined an entity set. For more information, see [Define Entity Set](https://help.sap.com/viewer/825270ffffe74d9f988a0f0066ad59f0/CF/en-US/3cf6b06b3c414481beddf6a7543bb985.html).




## Procedure

1.  In the canvas or on the *Outline* tab to the left of the canvas, choose an aggregate-type control that you want to turn into a template, such as a *List Item* control.

2.  In the properties pane to the right of the canvas, under the *Data Set* dropdown list, check the *Set as template* checkbox.

    This control becomes a template.

3.  In the *Confirmation Needed* dialog box, confirm the removal of any existing controls on the same level by clicking *OK*.




## Results

The template item is now marked *Template* in the *Outline* tab.
