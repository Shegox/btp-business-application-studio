# Push Changes

The Push option incorporates all unsynced committed changes into the remote branch of the currently checked-out local branch.



The number of unsynced committed changes is displayed next to the repository name. All tags created within the open repository are pushed.



> ### Note:  
> It is recommended to [pull changes](https://help.sap.com/products/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/952f893d45d1478d85b52448a663383f.html?locale=en-US) before pushing changes. This action ensures that your local copy is synced with the remote repository.
> 
> If a team member pushed to the remote repository and you push changes before syncing, you may encounter some issues, including head annotations or merge conflicts.
